## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use Next.js 15 (not 14) per research -- v14 reached EOL Oct 2025
- [Roadmap]: Supabase Broadcast for real-time chat delivery, direct DB inserts for persistence (two-path approach)
- [Roadmap]: Server-timestamp timer sync (store end_timestamp, clients compute remaining)
- [Roadmap]: Auth middleware must use getUser() not getSession()
- [01-01]: Pinned Next.js to v15.5 (create-next-app defaults to v16)
- [01-01]: getClaims() with getUser() fallback in middleware (runtime version check)
- [01-01]: Rewrote ESLint config for Next.js 15 compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Supabase free tier Realtime limit is 200 concurrent connections; ~80 users with 2-3 subscriptions each could hit ~240. Consider Pro tier ($25/mo) as insurance before the event.
- Broadcast authorization is channel-level, not row-level. Group isolation must be enforced via channel naming convention in Phase 3.
