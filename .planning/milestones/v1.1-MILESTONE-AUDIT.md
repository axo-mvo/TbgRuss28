# v1.1 Milestone Audit: Multi-Meeting Platform

**Milestone:** v1.1 Multi-Meeting Platform
**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** tech_debt (all requirements met, no critical blockers, accumulated tech debt needs review)
**Phases:** 5/5 complete (6, 7, 7.1, 8, 9)

## Requirements Coverage — 3-Source Cross-Reference (18/18)

All 18 v1.1 requirements are **satisfied** across all three independent verification sources.

| REQ-ID | Phase | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| MEET-01 | 7 | SATISFIED | 07-01 | [x] | satisfied |
| MEET-02 | 7 | SATISFIED | 07-02 | [x] | satisfied |
| MEET-03 | 6 | SATISFIED | 06-01, 06-02 | [x] | satisfied |
| MEET-04 | 7 | SATISFIED | 07-03 | [x] | satisfied |
| MEET-05 | 6 | SATISFIED | 06-01, 06-02 | [x] | satisfied |
| SCOPE-01 | 7, 7.1 | SATISFIED | 07-03, 07.1-01 | [x] | satisfied |
| SCOPE-02 | 8 | SATISFIED | 08-01, 08-03 | [x] | satisfied |

| DASH-04 | 9 | SATISFIED | 09-01 | [x] | satisfied |

**Orphaned requirements:** None. All 18 REQ-IDs in the traceability table are present in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md.

## Phase Verification Summary (5/5)

| Phase | Status | Score | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 06 - Schema Migration | human_needed | 5/5 | Migration SQL verified correct; production application requires manual confirmation |
| 07 - Admin Meeting Management | passed | 19/19 | All meeting CRUD, stations, groups, lifecycle, export, word cloud verified |
| 07.1 - Fix Phase 7 Integration Bugs | passed | 5/5 | reorderStations error handling, orphaned routes removed, revalidatePath fixed |
| 08 - Contact Directory and Dashboard | passed | 5/5 | Directory, attendance, meeting-state dashboard all verified |
| 09 - Meeting History | passed | 5/5 | History browsing, read-only discussions, station/group picker verified |

## Integration Check (17/18 wired, 8/8 flows complete)

### Cross-Phase Wiring

All 18 requirement integration paths were traced across phases. 17 are fully wired. 1 has a non-critical orphaned export.

**Orphaned Export (Low Severity):**
- `deleteMeeting` in `src/lib/actions/meeting.ts` lines 82-114 — fully implemented with status guards but no UI component calls it
- Admin has no path to delete an upcoming meeting via the UI
- Affects MEET-01 completeness (not explicitly required by the requirement definition but architecturally expected)

### E2E Flows (8/8 Complete)

| # | Flow | Requirements | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Admin creates meeting | MEET-01 | Complete |
| 2 | Admin configures stations | MEET-02 | Complete |
| 3 | Admin manages per-meeting groups | SCOPE-01 | Complete |
| 4 | Meeting lifecycle start/end | MEET-04 | Complete |
| 5 | Meeting-scoped export | SCOPE-04 | Complete |
| 6 | Per-meeting attendance | SCOPE-02 | Complete |
| 7 | Previous meetings browsable + history | DASH-02, DASH-03 | Complete |
| 8 | Admin consolidated meeting view | DASH-04 | Complete |

### Auth Protection

All routes properly guarded. No unprotected sensitive routes found.

---

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 6: Schema Migration
- **human_needed** — Production migration and zero-regression testing require manual verification via Supabase Dashboard

### Phase 7: Admin Meeting Management
- `StationList` line 309: `onDelete={() => {}}` no-op on read-only render path (unreachable but cosmetically present)

### Phase 8: Contact Directory and Dashboard
- `UpcomingMeetingCard` receives nullable Supabase fields (`time`, `venue`) without explicit null-coalescing — runtime risk if a meeting is created with null values
- Old `updateAttending` in `auth.ts` (lines 282-285) preserved for backward compatibility — dead code after SCOPE-02 migration to `meeting_attendance` table
- `dashboard/page.tsx` lines 227/239: hardcoded fallback defaults `'18:00'` and `'Ikke angitt'` for nullable fields

### Cross-Phase
- `deleteMeeting` server action has no UI consumer (orphaned export)

**Total: 6 items across 3 phases + 1 cross-phase**

## Previous Audit Gaps — Resolution Status

The first v1.1 audit (2026-02-26T01:00:00Z) identified 2 P1 bugs and 9 pending requirements:

| Previous Gap | Resolution |
|-------------|-----------|
| SCOPE-01 Supabase query builder mutation bug (createGroup, toggleGroupsLock) | Fixed in Phase 7.1 — reorderStations error handling added, orphaned routes removed, revalidatePath corrected |
| 8 pending requirements (SCOPE-02, DIR-01-04, DASH-01-02) | Completed in Phase 8 — all 7 requirements satisfied |
| 2 pending requirements (DASH-03, DASH-04) | Completed in Phase 9 — both requirements satisfied |
| reorderStations unawaited (P2 tech debt) | Fixed in Phase 7.1 — .then()/.catch() chain added |
| Orphaned /admin/groups and /admin/wordcloud routes | Fixed in Phase 7.1 — routes deleted |

All previous critical gaps are resolved.
